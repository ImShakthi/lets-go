## Moore Law
Moore's Law refers to Gordon Moore's observation on transistor and processing power. According to Moore's Law that
the number of transistors on a microchip will double every two years i.e transistor dense in chips will increase.
This states that we can expect the speed & the  capability of our computers will increase every two years, and we will pay less for them.

Moore's Law has its limitation where beyond a point where we can't achieve to make transistors smaller or increase the transistor density.

### Physical limitations
* Smaller transistors has a high heat extraction, so more the transistor on chip and more is the heat produce, which can let to malfunction.
* The latest production Intergated Circuits(ICs) have a minimum feature size of 7 nm, which is just 17 silicon atoms. Increasing transistor in chip will cause issue of quantum tunnelling, where **electrons leap through barriers and cause current leakage.**
